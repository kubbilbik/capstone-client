# SnackOverflow

## Overview

SnackOverflow is a personalized web-based platform designed to streamline the networking and portfolio-building processes for developers. It allows users to create a dynamic profile, showcasing their skills, projects, and professional journeys in a visually appealing format.

### Problem

Aspiring developers often struggle to distinguish themselves in a crowded job market. They need a way to showcase their technical skills, projects, and personality in one consolidated platform. Current solutions either lack interactivity, personalization, or are too generic for tech-oriented professionals.

### User Profile

SnackOverflow is tailored for new and experienced developers. They will use it to create and share their personal and professional profiles, connect with peers, and attract potential employers. Special considerations include ease of use for non-designers and the ability to import data from LinkedIn or GitHub to streamline profile creation.


### Features

Dynamic User Profiles: Users can input personal data, describe their expertise, and list their programming skills.

Project Showcase: Integration with GitHub to display repositories and contributions.

Connectivity: A feature for users to follow other developers, endorse skills, and build a professional network.

Responsive and Interactive Design: Ensuring that the web app is fully functional across various devices and screen sizes, with a horizontal scrolling feature for an engaging user experience.

## Implementation


### Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js for building the user interface, Sass for styling.

Backend: Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic.

### APIs

ChatGPT API: Utilized to generate personalized content for user profiles and to assist in creating interactive and engaging user biographies on the platform.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

### Auth

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.
